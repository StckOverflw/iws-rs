# IWS (but Rust)

This is a rewrite of my project [IWS](https://github.com/StckOverflw/iws) in Rust.

IWS is a private reporting system for german LGBTQ+ Servers. \
When reporting a user, all the other (verified) servers the bot is on will get a warning for that user and can decide if they want to ban them too with the reasons the other server provided.
